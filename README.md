## My process

### Built with

- Vue
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility

### What I learned

* I learned how to create responsive Grid layouts. The page not only adapts fluidly on different screen sizes,
but each view (mobile, tablet, and desktop) has also a different layout.
* I used SCSS mixins to create typography presets which can be easily applied to the desired elements.
They can also be swapped in different media queries which is not possible with SCSS placeholders.
* In addition, I implemented a "Skip to main content" button to enhance accessibility.
